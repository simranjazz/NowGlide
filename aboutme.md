### Background
My name is Gursimran. I have 11 years of professional experience in technical product management and development. Currently, working with EY GDS Global Managed Services on enterprise architecture, digital/delivery transformations and automations. Self-taught ServiceNow expert (Finance & supply chain, HRSD, ITSM).

In the last decade, I have worked in the capacity of a product owner, program manager, solution architect, solution consultant and of course, a developer. I have worked with clients in multiple industries and horizontals: HR, travel and tourism, manufacturing, telecom, e-commerce, financial services and life insurance.

### Why ServiceNow?
With little over 11 years of professional experience, I decided to learn ServiceNow in (the beginning of) 2025. Having built a solid foundation in Oracle B2C Service (formerly known as Oracle Service Cloud & RightNow CX) for over 9 years, I managed to easily transfer the similar skills and related concepts, over to ServiceNow. This helped me upskill on ServiceNow rapidly!

Back in 2023 and 2024, I worked on ServiceNow (as a user) and witnessed the massive potential of the platform. Originally an ITSM product, the entire platform is now killing it in HRSD, ITOM, ITAM, CSM and many more horizontals! Oracle B2C Service is similar to ServiceNow CSM product. But I realized that ServiceNow offers much more potential, like, the CMDB, flow designer (much powerful than business rules in OSvC), UI & data policies, workspaces, UI builder, ATF, performance analytics, and so much more!
