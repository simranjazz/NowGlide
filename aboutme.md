## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gursimran â€” Digital Transformation Enthusiast & ServiceNow Explorer

With over 11 years of experience in **product management**, **enterprise architecture**, and **solution delivery**, Iâ€™ve worn many hats â€” developer, architect, product owner, and program manager.

Currently at **EY GDS Global Managed Services**, I help clients transform business operations using modern platforms, automations, and scalable digital solutions.

## My Journey

I started in development, grew into product ownership, and eventually led complex programs across industries â€” **HR, telecom, e-commerce, insurance, and finance**.  
For nearly a decade, I specialized in **Oracle B2C Service (RightNow CX)** â€” designing scalable solutions that empowered both end-users and internal ops teams.

## Why ServiceNow?

In early 2025, I made the leap to **ServiceNow**. With a strong foundation in Oracle CX, the transition was smooth â€” and exciting.

I was quickly drawn to the **platform's breadth**:
- CMDB  
- Flow Designer  
- ATF  
- Workspaces & UI Builder  
- Data and UI Policies  
- Performance Analytics  

ServiceNow isnâ€™t just an ITSM tool anymore â€” itâ€™s redefining enterprise workflows across **HR, finance, supply chain, and customer service**.
