If you're trying to break into the ServiceNow ecosystem, you're probably feeling overwhelmed by its capabilities, acronyms, and modules. I felt the same when I began my journey. But there's one surprisingly helpful way to make sense of the platform early on: **understanding who uses it, and how.**

ServiceNow isn‚Äôt just about tables and flows. It‚Äôs also about the **people** working on it. Different roles see and shape the platform in very different ways. As a beginner, understanding these roles helps you:

- Discover where *you* fit  
- Understand what to learn next  
- Communicate better with stakeholders

This post breaks down the most common roles in the ServiceNow universe and how each one interacts with the platform.
