When I first started learning ServiceNow, I wasn‚Äôt sure where to begin. The platform is huge ‚Äî ITSM, HRSD, CSM, scripting, Flow Designer, UI Builder... it can feel overwhelming.
In this post, I‚Äôll share a simple, practical way to start learning ServiceNow without getting lost. Whether you‚Äôre an admin, developer, or just curious ‚Äî this guide will help you take your first steps confidently.

# 1. What is ServiceNow?
When I first started learning ServiceNow, I thought it was just a ticketing tool for IT support. But very quickly, I realized it‚Äôs much more than that.

ServiceNow is a powerful cloud platform that helps businesses manage and automate workflows across departments ‚Äî IT, HR, customer service, security, and more. It‚Äôs like a central engine that keeps things running smoothly inside large organizations. Instead of juggling emails, spreadsheets, or manual processes, teams use ServiceNow to build structured, trackable, and often automated workflows ‚Äî so that work gets done faster and more reliably. Whether you‚Äôre handling incidents, onboarding employees, approving hardware, or resolving customer issues ‚Äî there‚Äôs a good chance ServiceNow can be used to design, automate, and monitor the process.

As someone new to it, I‚Äôve come to think of it like this:
If Excel organizes numbers, and Gmail organizes messages, ServiceNow organizes work.

# 2. Set up a free personal developer instance (PDI)
Before you can start building anything on ServiceNow, you‚Äôll need a place to practice ‚Äî and the best part is: ServiceNow gives you one for free, well, one per account. It‚Äôs called a Personal Developer Instance (PDI).

> PDIs were launched at the Knowledge 15 event, in 2015, and ServiceNow witnessed over 21,000 registrations for the PDI, that year alone! And there were no other advertisements, no internet posts, no press release. Just the Knowledge 15. I learned this from episode 9 (Yes, I opened Podcasts and searched for the episode number >_>) of the ServiceNow TechBytes podcast.

A PDI is your own private copy of the ServiceNow platform, hosted in the cloud, just for you. It‚Äôs where you can click around, break things, experiment, build apps, and learn by doing - without needing your company‚Äôs access or worrying about messing up someone else‚Äôs system.

[PDI FAQs](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guides/yokohama/now-platform/faq/pdi_faq){:target="_blank"}

Here‚Äôs how I got mine in under 10 minutes:

* Go to [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com){:target="_blank"}
* Sign up for a free account
* Once logged in, click ‚ÄúRequest Instance‚Äù
* Choose the latest release (unless you need something specific)
* Wait for a few minutes ‚Äî and your own ServiceNow instance is live!
* You‚Äôll get a unique URL like https://dev-12345.service-now.com and full admin access ‚Äî which means you can try almost everything the platform offers. Trust me, having a PDI changed the way I learn. It‚Äôs not just reading anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs doing.

> ServiceNow does not offer support for PDIs. I've only ever experienced an outage on PDIs once, which was addressed by ServiceNow, in a few weeks. In case you are not able to access your PDI during a declared outage, I would suggest to wait, the instance will be back up when the outage is over. If you don't have any data/config/customizations to get back to, then you can release the current instance and request for a new one.

PDI instances expire after 10 days of inactivity. Do login every few days!
# 3. ServiceNow official learning platform
Once your developer instance is ready, the next big question is: "Where do I actually start learning?"
The answer is easy ‚Äî ServiceNow‚Äôs official learning portal.

It‚Äôs called [ServiceNow University](https://learning.servicenow.com){:target="_blank"} (Used to be called NowLearning) and it‚Äôs the best place to begin. It‚Äôs completely free, and it has structured learning paths for beginners, admins, developers, architects, and more.

When I first logged in, I found the courses well-organized and beginner-friendly. You can start with:

* üü¢ ServiceNow Basics ‚Äì great for understanding the interface and core features
* üß© Application Development Fundamentals ‚Äì if you want to build apps
* üõ†Ô∏è ITSM Fundamentals ‚Äì if you're leaning toward IT support processes

They even offer badges and certificates for many of the modules, which is a nice motivator ‚Äî and a good thing to add to your LinkedIn or resume.

> My approach to learning was different, I learned it all by going through [ServiceNow official documentation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/){:target="_blank"}. It was important for me to understand the core platform first, the Now Platform, now called ServiceNow AI Platform. Yes, as of May 2025, in a press release, and also at Knowledge 2025, ServiceNow has renamed Now Platform to ServiceNow AI Platform. My way of learning was to learn the [ServiceNow AI Platform](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/csh?topicname=now-platform-landing.html&version=latest){:target="_blank"} through its official documentaiton, top down & sequentially. Most would find this method monotonous, but I believe documentation is the only and single source of truth, for a product, the bible, and I found this method quite intertesting, all through!
# 4. Learn core modules first
When I first opened my ServiceNow instance, I was blown away by how many modules there were ‚Äî ITSM, HRSD, CSM, SecOps, App Engine, and so on. It was like walking into a giant airport and not knowing which terminal to go to.

So here‚Äôs what helped me:
I focused first on the core modules ‚Äî the ones that most companies use and most interviews care about.

Start with these three:

* üîß Incident, Problem, and Change Management (ITSM)
These are the heart of IT workflows in ServiceNow. Learn how tickets (aka ‚Äúrecords‚Äù) flow through different states, how users interact with them, and how SLAs work.
* üìÑ Knowledge Management
This teaches you how companies store and share documentation inside ServiceNow ‚Äî a surprisingly important skill when building any real-world solution.
* üìã Request Management & Catalog Items
Want to learn how to create a self-service portal where users can order things like laptops or access? This is where that magic happens.
By starting with these, you‚Äôll get used to key concepts like forms, lists, workflows, user roles (ACLs), approvals, and data structures. And you‚Äôll start seeing the platform not just as a tool, but as a framework for how real businesses operate.

Later, you can explore advanced or niche modules ‚Äî but these basics are where 90% of new learners (and jobs!) begin.
# 5. Learn to customize - without code first!
# 6. Gradually start scripting
# 7. Join the community


The key to learning ServiceNow is to stay consistent and hands-on. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment ‚Äî break your PDI, request a new one, try again. The platform is very deep, and the more you build, the more you learn.
I‚Äôm still learning myself ‚Äî if you have questions, feel free to email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
