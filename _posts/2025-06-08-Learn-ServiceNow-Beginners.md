When I first started learning ServiceNow, I wasn’t sure where to begin. The platform is huge — ITSM, HRSD, CSM, scripting, Flow Designer, UI Builder... it can feel overwhelming.
In this post, I’ll share a simple, practical way to start learning ServiceNow without getting lost. Whether you’re an admin, developer, or just curious — this guide will help you take your first steps confidently.

# 1. What is ServiceNow?
When I first started learning ServiceNow, I thought it was just a ticketing tool for IT support. But very quickly, I realized it’s much more than that.

ServiceNow is a powerful cloud platform that helps businesses manage and automate workflows across departments — IT, HR, customer service, security, and more. It’s like a central engine that keeps things running smoothly inside large organizations. Instead of juggling emails, spreadsheets, or manual processes, teams use ServiceNow to build structured, trackable, and often automated workflows — so that work gets done faster and more reliably. Whether you’re handling incidents, onboarding employees, approving hardware, or resolving customer issues — there’s a good chance ServiceNow can be used to design, automate, and monitor the process.

As someone new to it, I’ve come to think of it like this:
If Excel organizes numbers, and Gmail organizes messages, ServiceNow organizes work.

# 2. Set up a free personal developer instance (PDI)
Before you can start building anything on ServiceNow, you’ll need a place to practice — and the best part is: ServiceNow gives you one for free, well, one per account. It’s called a Personal Developer Instance (PDI).

> PDIs were launched at the Knowledge 15 event, in 2015, and ServiceNow witnessed over 21,000 registrations for the PDI, that year alone! And there were no other advertisements, no internet posts, no press release. Just the Knowledge 15. I learned this from episode 9 (Yes, I opened Podcasts and searched for the episode number >_>) of the ServiceNow TechBytes podcast.

A PDI is your own private copy of the ServiceNow platform, hosted in the cloud, just for you. It’s where you can click around, break things, experiment, build apps, and learn by doing - without needing your company’s access or worrying about messing up someone else’s system.

Here’s how I got mine in under 10 minutes:

* Go to [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com){:target="_blank"}
* Sign up for a free account
* Once logged in, click “Request Instance”
* Choose the latest release (unless you need something specific)
* Wait for a few minutes — and your own ServiceNow instance is live!
* You’ll get a unique URL like https://dev-12345.service-now.com and full admin access — which means you can try almost everything the platform offers. Trust me, having a PDI changed the way I learn. It’s not just reading anymore — it’s doing.

> ServiceNow does not offer support for PDIs. I've only ever experienced an outage on PDIs once, which was addressed by ServiceNow, in a few weeks. In case you are not able to access your PDI during a declared outage, I would suggest to wait, the instance will be back up when the outage is over. If you don't have any data/config/customizations to get back to, then you can release the current instance and request for a new one.

PDI instances expire after 10 days of inactivity. Do login every few days!

# 3. ServiceNow official learning platform
Once your developer instance is ready, the next big question is: "Where do I actually start learning?"
The answer is easy — ServiceNow’s official learning portal.

It’s called Now Learning and it’s the best place to begin. It’s completely free, and it has structured learning paths for beginners, admins, developers, architects, and more.

When I first logged in, I found the courses well-organized and beginner-friendly. You can start with:

🟢 ServiceNow Basics – great for understanding the interface and core features
🧩 Application Development Fundamentals – if you want to build apps
🛠️ ITSM Fundamentals – if you're leaning toward IT support processes
They even offer badges and certificates for many of the modules, which is a nice motivator — and a good thing to add to your LinkedIn or resume.
# 4. Learn core modules first
# 5. Learn to customize - without code first!
# 6. Gradually start scripting
# 7. Join the community


The key to learning ServiceNow is to stay consistent and hands-on. Don’t be afraid to experiment — break your PDI, request a new one, try again. The platform is very deep, and the more you build, the more you learn.
I’m still learning myself — if you have questions, feel free to email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
