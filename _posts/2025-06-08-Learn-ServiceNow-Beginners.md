When I first started learning ServiceNow, I wasn’t sure where to begin. The platform is huge — ITSM, HRSD, CSM, scripting, Flow Designer, UI Builder... it can feel overwhelming.
In this post, I’ll share a simple, practical way to start learning ServiceNow without getting lost. Whether you’re an admin, developer, or just curious — this guide will help you take your first steps confidently.

# 1. What is ServiceNow?
When I first started learning ServiceNow, I thought it was just a ticketing tool for IT support. But very quickly, I realized it’s much more than that.

ServiceNow is a powerful cloud platform that helps businesses manage and automate workflows across departments — IT, HR, customer service, security, and more. It’s like a central engine that keeps things running smoothly inside large organizations. Instead of juggling emails, spreadsheets, or manual processes, teams use ServiceNow to build structured, trackable, and often automated workflows — so that work gets done faster and more reliably. Whether you’re handling incidents, onboarding employees, approving hardware, or resolving customer issues — there’s a good chance ServiceNow can be used to design, automate, and monitor the process.

As someone new to it, I’ve come to think of it like this:
If Excel organizes numbers, and Gmail organizes messages, ServiceNow organizes work.

# 2. Set up a free personal developer instance (PDI)
# 3. ServiceNow official learning platform
# 4. Learn core modules first
# 5. Learn to customize - without code first!
# 6. Gradually start scripting
# 7. Join the community


The key to learning ServiceNow is to stay consistent and hands-on. Don’t be afraid to experiment — break your PDI, request a new one, try again. The platform is very deep, and the more you build, the more you learn.
I’m still learning myself — if you have questions, feel free to email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
