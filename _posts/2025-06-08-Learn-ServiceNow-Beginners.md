When I first started learning ServiceNow, I wasn’t sure where to begin. The platform is huge — ITSM, HRSD, CSM, scripting, Flow Designer, UI Builder... it can feel overwhelming.
In this post, I’ll share a simple, practical way to start learning ServiceNow without getting lost. Whether you’re an admin, developer, or just curious — this guide will help you take your first steps confidently.

# 1. What is ServiceNow?
Enterprise transformation. Orchestrate AI, data and workflows. ServiceNow AI platform unifies intelligence, data and orchestration. Do read the official article on [What is ServiceNow (Official)?](https://www.servicenow.com/what-is-servicenow.html)
# 2. Set up a free personal developer instance (PDI)
# 3. ServiceNow official learning platform
# 4. Learn core modules first
# 5. Learn to customize - without code first!
# 6. Gradually start scripting
# 7. Join the community


The key to learning ServiceNow is to stay consistent and hands-on. Don’t be afraid to experiment — break your PDI, request a new one, try again. The platform is very deep, and the more you build, the more you learn.
I’m still learning myself — if you have questions, feel free to email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
