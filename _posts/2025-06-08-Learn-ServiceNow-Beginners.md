When I first started learning ServiceNow, I wasn’t sure where to begin. The platform is huge — ITSM, HRSD, CSM, scripting, Flow Designer, UI Builder... it can feel overwhelming.
In this post, I’ll share a simple, practical way to start learning ServiceNow without getting lost. Whether you’re an admin, developer, or just curious — this guide will help you take your first steps confidently.

# 1. What is ServiceNow?
## The beginner-friendly answer
ServiceNow is a tool that helps companies manage and organize their work better. Imagine a smart system that tracks tasks, automates approvals, helps teams talk to each other, and makes sure nothing gets lost or delayed. That’s what ServiceNow does — for IT teams, HR, customer service, and more.

Instead of sending emails back and forth, ServiceNow gives you a central place to handle requests, fix issues, and get things done faster — all in one smooth platform.
